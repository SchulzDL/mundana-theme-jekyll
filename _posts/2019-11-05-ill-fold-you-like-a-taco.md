Several years ago we bought these sunscreens for our car.  They were oval in shape and streched vinal fabric that had a wire like outside edge.  They were actually made in the city next door to us, Moorpark and I found the instructions quite halarious.

There were two tabs on each end of the sunscreens which had finger prints on them and the instructions were to fold like a taco which would then roll into smaller pieces like one quarter of the size for easy storage.

To get the humor in this you have to think about your oldest grandfather like voice and your are saying to someone else that you are upset with.
